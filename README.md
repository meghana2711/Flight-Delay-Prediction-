# Flight-Delay-Prediction-
The purpose of this project is to assist airlines, passengers, and other stakeholders in making informed decisions based on the predicted flight delays. By leveraging historical flight data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors, the system can generate predictions that help identify potential delays in advance. The project's implementation with IBM Cloud allows for the utilization of various services, which provides a collaborative environment for data analysis and model development. Additionally, the integration with Flask enables the creation of a web application that allows users to input flight details and receive delay predictions in real-time.

The "Flight Delay Prediction using IBM Cloud " project aims to develop a solution that leverages machine learning and IBM Cloud services to accurately predict flight delays. The proposed solution offers advantages such as proactive decision making, user-friendly interface, integration with Flask, continuous improvement, and potential applications in airline operations, passenger travel planning, airport management, and more. Despite limitations related to data availability and quality, external factors, and user dependency, the project emphasizes ongoing efforts for refinement and improvement. Overall, the project contributes to optimizing airline operations and enhancing the passenger experience in the aviation industry.
